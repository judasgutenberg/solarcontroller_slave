# solarcontroller_slave
Arduino code controlling the LCD interface, IR remote, and some sensors beyond what the master solarcontroller could address.


This goes with the Masterman2 sketch to control a solar hot water system.  The master and slave communicate via I2C.

Note: the .pde version dates to the first release of the Arduino IDE.  I later migrated it to an .ino file compatible with more modern versions of the IDE.
